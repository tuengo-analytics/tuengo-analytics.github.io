title: About me

I'm developing this page as my journal delving into the field of machine learning. I have started learning ML 2 years ago, and continue to find it is quite intellectually exciting. I'm an applied physicist, and have work experience in hard disk drive industry. What I love to do is analyzing analog signals from sensors such as magnetic, acoustic, temperature, humidity, etc. I'm looking for a new way to use machine learning to unravel the wealth of data coming from the sensors that are trying to tell us about our environment. This page is under construction. Please drop a few lines to say hello. Thank you for visiting my page.
