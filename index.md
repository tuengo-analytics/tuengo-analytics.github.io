### 1. Interactive Map and Embedded Data

The first project shown here is an interactive COVID-19 map showing daily fatalities by country/region.

### 2. Data Mining

My second project is to develop a tool to automate the search of molecular absorption spectra in [HITRAN database](https://www.HITRAN.org).  The aim is to develop an optical analyzer to detect gas species such as H2S, CO2, and H2O simultaneously.

### 3. Detection and Classifying Servicing Vehicles in Real Time

Machine learning applied in computer vision is a powerful tool to detect and classifying objects.  Performing these tasks in real time requires a fast machine learning algorithm.  In this project, a convolution neural network (CNN) called YOLO (You Only Look Once) is used to demonstrate the speed of detection and classification in real time.  The objects we want to detect in this project are the types of servicing vehicles (UPS, FedEx, USPS, police cars, etc.) captured by a dash board camera.
